# Air-Pollution-Forecasting
Forecasting air pollution using KERAS in Python
Air pollution is the contamination of air by harmful substances such as gases, particulates, and biological
molecules. It is mainly caused by burning of fossil fuels, agricultural activities (such as excessive use of
pesticides, insecticides and fertilizers), exhaust from factories and industries, mining activities and due to
household activities. Air pollution can cause respiratory and heart problems in human beings. It is also the
main reason for serious issues, such as global warming, acid rain, eutrophication and depletion of the
ozone layer. Air pollution is a very serious issue in the modern world and it is necessary to keep the levels
of pollution to a minimum for sustainable life
PM2.5 is one of the attributes that measures the quality of air and in this project we use PM2.5 as the
measure for air pollution. PM2.5 particles have diameters less than or equal to 2.5 microns and are also
called fine particles. They are very light particles and tend to stay longer in the air. Due to the small size,
these particles can travel more deeper into the lungs and cause very harmful effects to life.
Forecasting the PM2.5 levels will give an insight about the upcoming pollution levels and using this,
necessary measures can be taken in advance to tackle the problem of air pollution. In this project, we will
forecast the pollution at the next hour using the weather conditions and pollution of the prior hours. The
LSTM model of KERAS package in python is used for forecasting.
